Smart Stick for Blind People Using Arduino UNO and Ultrasonic Sensor

**Description**  
This project, presents a Smart Stick designed to aid blind individuals in navigating their surroundings. Leveraging an Arduino UNO board and an ultrasonic sensor, this device detects obstacles and provides real-time feedback through a buzzer. The goal is to enhance the independence and safety of visually impaired individuals.

**Features**  
- **Obstacle Detection:** Accurately measures distances and identifies obstacles in the user's path using the ultrasonic sensor.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Provides immediate audio feedback via a buzzer to signal the proximity of objects.
- **Adjustable Warning Levels:** Emits varying frequencies and durations of sound based on the distance of detected objects.
- **User-Friendly:** Designed to be lightweight and easy to handle, offering an effective navigation aid.

**Components**  
- Arduino UNO board
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Buzzer
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

**Circuit Diagram**  
A detailed circuit diagram is included in the repository to guide assembly.

**Installation and Usage**  
1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Connect the components as outlined in the circuit diagram.
3. Upload the Arduino code (`smart_stick_code.ino`) to your Arduino UNO using the Arduino IDE.
4. Ensure secure connections and proper component functionality.
5. Power on the system and test the smart stick by placing obstacles at varying distances.

**Usage Example**  
- **Slow Beeps:** Indicate that objects are relatively far away.
- **Medium Beeps:** Signal that objects are at a moderate distance.
- **Rapid Beeps:** Warn of objects very close, requiring immediate attention.

As you move the smart stick, it continuously provides feedback, enhancing navigation safety.
